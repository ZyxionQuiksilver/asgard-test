# Asgard-Test
This repo is the storage of a series of Chef recipes that can be used to build out a complete web host stack. Various portions of the stack will include:

	-Reverse Proxy (With SSL termination)
	-Content Caching
	-Webserver
	-Database Caching
	-Database

The idea is to build these recipes with a single environment in mind. Network addressing should not matter due to all traffic between these servers being on Private IP ranges.

Disclaimer time- I'm completely new to all of this. Chef, ruby, the entire idea of a Webserver stack, all of it. I don't know the correct terms, verbage, or even common nicknames to any of this. The entire idea behind this is... well, fun and profit. Fun learning everything I can about this fabled stack. Fun learning Chef (and config management, in general). Fun learning Ruby. While I have a few contacts related to these ideas, I'm not part of any communities. I'm just a guy, trying this out.

This repo in particular will more than likely be cloned into something new once it gets some meat and potatoes. It's gunna look strange, if not down right stupid, at times. If you happen to come across this randomly, don't judge!
